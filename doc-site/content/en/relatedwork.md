We acknowledge the hard work and incredible contributions from everyone below.

* [Cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics) describes the "closed signaling loop", the essence of Unidirectional Data Flow architectures (aka MVI or Model View Intent).
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org) (and Flux) are popular Javascript state management frameworks organized around Unidirectional Data Flow. There are similar implementations for different platforms
* [re-frame/Clojure](https://github.com/day8/re-frame). Unidirectional Data Flow for Clojurescript
* [Functional Reactive Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming) (FRP) is not new.
* [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io) is a popular reactive programming implementation for many different imperative languages. 
* [Mobius](https://github.com/spotify/mobius) is another take on Unidirectional Data Flow for the Android platform.
* [Observers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) aren't new.
* [Cycle.js](https://cycle.js.org) Javascript reactive library.
