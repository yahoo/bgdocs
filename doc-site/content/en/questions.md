While we have given the current feature set a lot of consideration, we cannot understand all your constraints.
Let us know what you are thinking.
Your questions and feedback help us.

### Ideas 
* You want to more about how something works?
* You want to know why something works the way it does?
* How to integrate with your favorite library?
* What is a good pattern for expressing your particular problem?
* Do you have an interesting use case?
* Have you hit a barrier that makes it impossible to use?

## Channels

At the moment we would like to avoid creating yet one more community you need to sign up for.
Use these existing channels instead.

For questions or feedback related to this documentation we have a separate Github Repository:

### Stack Overflow

We will monitor StackOverflow for [Behavior Graph related questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/behavior-graph) if you tag them with `behavior-graph`.
